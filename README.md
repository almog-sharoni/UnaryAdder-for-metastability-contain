Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of three digital adders: a Binary Adder, a Gray-Coded Adder, and a novel Unary Adder with an integrated sorting network. The primary focus is on the Unary Adder design, which aims to enhance metastability handling and address potential computation accuracy issues found in traditional Gray-Coded and Binary Adders. The Binary and Gray-Coded adders establish a baseline for comparison.
The Unary Adder leverages unary number representation, where numbers are represented by a sequence of consecutive '1's. It incorporates a sorting network to resolve potentially metastable input bits, forcing them into valid logic states. The adders' designs are implemented in Verilog.
Simulation and analysis (details to be included in the full documentation) will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each adder in mitigating metastability- related issues. Performance metrics such as propagation delay, area utilization , metastability impact on computation accuracy will be used to facilitate a comprehensive comparison.
